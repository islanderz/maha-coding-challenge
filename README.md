## Development Environment 

OS: Mac OS X
Editor: Eclipse 2020
JAVA version 1.8.0_191
Maven version 3.6.3

## Technologies 

* Spring 2.3  
* SpringBoot and SpringBootTest
* Atlas MongoDB cloud service
* Swagger UI

## Setup
Clone git repository: https://github.com/islanderz/maha-coding-challenge.git

Build with maven: maven clean install

Swagger provides a very handy way to svisualize and interact with the API’s deployed, and to try out with sample requests.
